# Introduction #

SLB is a wrapper library to access C/C++ code from lua with the same object oriented capabilities we have in C++ (with some minor exceptions) and without any external requirements (no **boost**, or other libraries).

# Adding SLB to your project #

SLB can easily be embedded in your own project. Compile all the files from the _src_ directory, there are .cpp files which are SLB's main code and a _lua.c_ file with the whole [lua](http://www.lua.org). You also will need to instruct your compiler to look for SLB's headers from the _include_ directory.

If your code is a dynamic library, you are on windows and you want to expose SLB to your library's users then define the macro `SLB_LIBRARY` to export symbols (see _include/SLB/Export.hpp_ for details).

You can also compile SLB as an independent dynamic library, for that you can use CMake files from the project.

# API #

SLB API is divided in two parts. Managers and wrapping code.

## SLB::Manager ##

A Manager in SLB holds information of how manage C++ code. There is a default manager that will be used if no manager is specified see `SLB::Manager::defaultManager()`.

To use SLB inside a lua\_State a Manager must be registered inside the lua\_State, see `SLB::Manager::registerSLB(lua_State *)`. Once a manager is attached to a lua\_State (and only one manager can be ever be attached to a lua\_State) you can start using your C methods and C++ classes. Additionally a SLB table is created with some useful functions.

To summarize the process here a typical snippet of code to prepare a lua\_State to use SLB registered classes:

```
// Create a lua State, using normal lua API
lua_State *L = luaL_newstate();

// load default functions (optional)
luaL_openlibs(L);

// Register SLB inside the lua_State, we use here the
// default manager, but any SLB::Manager could be used.
SLB::Manager::defaultManager().registerSLB(L);

// Now we can start using lua API to execute code
luaL_dostring(L, lua_code);
```

If you want to automatically handle this process you can use SLB::Script as a high level interface with lua scripts.

## Wrapping code ##

This is an example of the typical code wrapped into SLB:

```
SLB::Class< MyClass >("Namespace::MyClass")
  // declares an empty constructor
  .constructor()
  .set("getString", &MyClass::getString)
  .set("setString", &MyClass::setString)
  .set("getInt", &MyClass::getInt)
  .set("setInt", &MyClass::setInt)
;
```

Here we are wrapping the class `MyClass` with a default constructor, and methods `getString`, `setString`, `getInt` `setInt`. The above piece of code must be inside a function that gets called before any attempt to use the class from a lua script. Also the code must be executed once per SLB::Manager instance (in the example the class is registered into the default manager).

If you want to keep your classes in different managers (for security reasons, to limit the accessibility of the script, ...) the first line will change to:
```
SLB::Class< MyClass >("Namespace::MyClass", MyManagerPointer)
...
```

where `MyManagerPointer` is a pointer to an instance of SLB::Manager.
